    Trains the model.

    Note that when you iterate through dataloader, each batch will returned as its own vector in the form
    (batch_size x length of word x self.num_chars). However, in order to run multiple samples at the same time,
    get_loss() and run() expect each batch to be in the form (length of word x batch_size x self.num_chars), meaning
    that you need to switch the first two dimensions of every batch. This can be done with the movedim() function 
    as follows:

    movedim(input_vector, initial_dimension_position, final_dimension_position)
